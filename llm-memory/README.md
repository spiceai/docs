# LLM Memory: Persistent Memory for Language Models with Spice

Spice provides persistent memory capabilities for language models, enabling them to retain key information from conversations across sessions. This feature supports building more context-aware and intelligent applications by maintaining memory continuity.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following before starting:

- [Spice CLI](https://docs.spiceai.org/getting-started) installed.
- The following environment variables set:
  - `SPICE_OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Using LLM Memory

**Step 1.** Run Spice runtime

```shell
spice run
```

**Step 3.** Start a chat session

```shell
spice chat
```

**Step 4.** Interact with the model

```shell
>>> spice chat

chat> Hi, my name is Alice and I work as a software engineer
Hi Alice! It's nice to meet you. How can I assist you today?

chat>  I live in Seattle. Tell me a joke about it
Sure, here's a Seattle-themed joke for you:

Why don't Seattle folks get lost in the woods?

Because they always follow the trail of coffee cups back home! ☕🌲

Hope that gives you a chuckle! Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to know or chat about.
```

**Step 5.** Check stored memories

```shell
spice sql
```

Then:

```sql
SELECT id, value FROM llm_memory;
```

Output:

```shell
+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| id                                   | value                               |
+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| 019319e4-ca14-7a12-a91a-f2c73528d304 | User's name is Alice                |
| 019319e4-ca14-7a12-a91a-f2d52fb70fba | Alice is a software engineer        |
| 019319e4-ca14-7a12-a91a-f2e2656ff222 | Alice lives in Seattle              |
+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
```

### Using Memory Tools Directly

**Step 1.** Store a memory directly

```shell
curl -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:8090/v1/tool/store_memory -d '{"thoughts": ["Alice deserves a promotion"]}'
```

**Step 2.** Load stored memories

```shell
curl -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:8090/v1/tool/load_memory -d '{"last": "10m"}'
```

Output:

```json
[
  "Users name is Alice",
  "Alice is a software engineer",
  "Alice lives in Seattle",
  "Alice thinks she deserves a promotion"
]
```
