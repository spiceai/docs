# Spice.ai

Powerful and easy-to-use AI for developers.

Spice.ai is an open source, portable runtime for training and using deep learning on time series data. It's written in Golang and Python and runs as a container or microservice with applications calling a simple HTTP API. It's deployable to any public cloud, on-premises, and edge.

The Spice.ai runtime also includes a library of community-driven components for streaming and processing time series data, with the vision of enabling developers to quickly and easily combine data with learning to create intelligent models.

Modern developers also build with the community by leveraging registries such as npm, NuGet, and pip. The registry for sharing and using Spice.ai packages is [spicerack.org](https://spicerack.org). As the community shares more and more AI building blocks, developers can quickly build intelligence into their applications, initially with definitions of AI projects and eventually by sharing and reusing fully-trained models.

‚ö†Ô∏è Spice.ai is under active alpha stage development and is not intended to be used in production until its 1.0-stable release.

Spice.ai and spicerack.org are both pre-release, early, alpha software. Spice.ai v0.1-alpha has many gaps, including limited deep learning algorithms and training scale, streaming data, simulated environments, and offline learning modes. Packages aren't searchable or even listed on spicerack.org yet.

The vision to bring intelligent application development to the maturity of modern web development is a vast undertaking. We haven't figured it all out or solved all the problems yet. We're looking for feedback on the direction. It's not finished, in fact, we only just started in June, and we invite you on the journey.
