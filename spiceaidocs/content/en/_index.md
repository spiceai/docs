# Spice.ai

Welcome to the Spice.ai Developer Preview and thank you for your engagement in early Spice.ai development.

Our intention with this preview is to work with developers early to co-define and co-develop the developer experience, aligning to the goal of making AI easy for developers. üöÄ Thus, due to the stage of development and as we focus, there are currently several [limitations](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/docs/ROADMAP.md#current-limitations) on the general [Roadmap to v1.0-stable](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/docs/ROADMAP.md#spice-ai-v10-stable-roadmap).

We greatly appreciate and value your feedback. Please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/issues/new) and get in touch with the team through [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/803820740868571196) or by sending us mail at [team@spiceai.io](mailto:team@spiceai.io).

Thank you for sharing this journey with us! üôè
