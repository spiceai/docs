The Spice.ai engine learns and provides recommendations to your application using a type of AI called deep reinforcement learning. To learn more, see [Deep Learning AI]({{<ref "deep-learning-ai">}}).

In deep reinforcement learning, rewards are used to control what the AI engine optimizes for. In Spice.ai you can author the reward functions either inline the Pod manifest YAML or in a separate Python file.
