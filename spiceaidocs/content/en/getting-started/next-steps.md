Congratulations! In just a few minutes you downloaded and installed the Spice.ai CLI and runtime, created your first Spice.ai pod, trained it, and got a recommendation from it.

This is just the start of the journey with Spice.ai. Next, try one of the quickstart tutorials or more in-depth samples for creating intelligent applications with Spice.ai.

**Try:**

- [ServerOps sample](https://github.com/spiceai/samples/tree/trunk/serverops) - a more in-depth version of the quickstart you just completed, using live CPU metrics from your own machine
- [Trader](https://github.com/spiceai/quickstarts/tree/trunk/trader) - a basic sample Bitcoin trading bot
