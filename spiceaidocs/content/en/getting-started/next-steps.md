Congratulations! In just a few minutes you downloaded and installed the Spice.ai CLI and runtime, created your first Spice.ai Pod, trained it, and got a recommendation from it.

This is just the start of your journey with AI. Next, try one of the quickstart tutorials or in-depth samples for creating intelligent applications with Spice.ai.

**Try:**

- [Log Pruner sample](https://github.com/spiceai/samples/tree/trunk/logpruner) - a more in-depth version of the quickstart you just completed, using CPU metrics from your own machine
- [Trader](https://github.com/spiceai/quickstarts/tree/trunk/trader) - a basic Bitcoin trading bot

**Kubernetes:**

Spice.ai can be deployed to Kubernetes! Try out the [Kubernetes sample](https://github.com/spiceai/samples/tree/trunk/kubernetes).
