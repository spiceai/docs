Use [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) to query and visualize datasets loaded in Spice.

> Apache Superset is a modern, enterprise-ready business intelligence web application. It is fast, lightweight, intuitive, and loaded with options that make it easy for users of all skill sets to explore and visualize their data, from simple pie charts to highly detailed deck.gl geospatial charts.

## Start Apache Superset with Flight SQL & DataFusion SQL Dialect support

Superset requires a Python [DB API 2](https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/) database driver and a [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) dialect to be installed for each connected datastore. Spice implements a Flight SQL server that understands the DataFusion SQL Dialect. The [`flightsql-dbapi`](https://pypi.org/project/flightsql-dbapi/) library for Python provides the required DB API 2 driver and SQLAlchemy dialect.

Select the appropriate tab based on whether you are experimenting with this feature or integrating it into an existing Superset instance.

    The easiest way to connect Apache Superset and Spice is to follow the [`Sales BI` sample](https://github.com/spiceai/samples/tree/trunk/sales-bi). This sample builds a local Docker image based on Apache Superset that is pre-configured with the `flightsql-dbapi` library needed to connect to Spice.

    Clone the Spice samples repository and navigate to the `sales-bi` directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/spiceai/samples.git
    cd samples/sales-bi
    ```

    Start Apache Superset along with the Spice runtime in Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    make start
    ```

    Log into Apache Superset at [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088) with the username and password `admin/admin`.

    Follow the below steps to configure a database connection to Spice manually, or run `make import-dashboards` to automatically configure the connection and create a sample dashboard.

    ## Generic / Virtual Machine
    Install the `flightsql-dbapi` library in your existing Apache Superset environment:

    ```bash
    pip install flightsql-dbapi
    ```

    ## Docker Container
    Install the library in the Dockerfile:

    ```Dockerfile
    FROM apache/superset
    # Switching to root to install the required packages
    USER root
    # https://github.com/influxdata/flightsql-dbapi
    RUN pip install flightsql-dbapi
    # Switching back to using the `superset` user
    USER superset
    ```

    Re-deploy Apache Superset with the updated Docker image.

    ## Temporary Docker Container Modification
    It's possible to modify a running Docker container to install the library, but the change will be lost on container restart.
      
    ```bash
    docker exec -u root -it superset /bin/bash

    pip install flightsql-dbapi
    ```

## Configure a Spice Connection

Once Apache Superset is up and running, and you are logged in, you can configure a connection to Spice.

Hover over the `Settings` menu and select `Database Connections`.

Click the `+ Database` button to configure the connection.

<img width="800" src="/img/superset/superset-docs-new-db.png" />

Under `Supported Databases` select `Other`.

Set the Display Name to `Spice` and the SQL Alchemy URI to `datafusion+flightsql://spiceai_host:[spiceai_port]`. Specify `?insecure=true` to skip connecting over TLS.

Example: `datafusion+flightsql://spiceai-sales-bi-demo:50090?insecure=true`.

Click `Test Connection` to verify the connection.

Click `Connect` to save the connection.

Start exploring the datasets loaded in Spice by creating a new dataset in Apache Superset to match one of the existing tables.
