## Slow data applications

Colocate a local working set of hot data with data applications and frontends to serve more concurrent requests and users with faster page loads and data updates.

[Try the CQRS sample app](https://github.com/spiceai/samples/tree/trunk/acceleration#local-materialization-and-acceleration-cqrs-sample)

## Fragile data applications

Keep local replicas of data with the application for significantly higher application resilience and availability.

## Slow dashboards, analytics, and BI

Create a materialization layer for visualization products like Power BI, Tableau, or Superset for faster, more responsive dashboards without massive compute costs.

[Watch the Apache Superset demo](https://github.com/spiceai/samples/blob/trunk/sales-bi/README.md)
