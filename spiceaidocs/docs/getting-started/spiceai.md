You can use any number of predefined datasets available from the Spice.ai Cloud Platform in the Spice runtime.

A list of publically available datasets from Spice.ai can be found here: [https://docs.spice.ai/building-blocks/datasets](https://docs.spice.ai/building-blocks/datasets).

In order to access public datasets from Spice, you will first need to create an account with Spice.ai by selecting the free tier membership.

Navigate to [spice.ai](https://spice.ai/) and create a new account by clicking on Try for Free.

After creating an account, you will need to create an app in order to create to an API key.

You will now be able to access datasets from the Spice.ai Platform. For this quickstart, we will be using the `eth.recent_blocks` dataset.

**Step 1.** Log in and authenticate from the command line using the `spice login` command. A pop up browser window will prompt you to authenticate:

```bash
spice login
```

**Step 2.** Initialize a new project and start the runtime:

```bash
# Initialize a new Spice app
spice init spice_app

# Change to app directory
cd spice_app

# Start the runtime
spice run
```

**Step 3.** Configure the dataset:

In a new terminal window, configure a new dataset using the `spice dataset configure` command:

```bash
spice dataset configure
```

Enter a dataset name that will be used to reference the dataset in queries. This name does not need to match the name in the dataset source.

```bash
dataset name: (spice_app) eth_recent_blocks
```

Enter the description of the dataset:

```
description: Recent Ethereum blocks
```

Enter the location of the dataset:

```bash
from: spice.ai/eth.recent_blocks
```

Select `y` when prompted whether to accelerate the data:

```bash
Locally accelerate (y/n)? y
```

You should see the following output from your runtime terminal:

```bash
2024-05-20T22:50:17.997446Z  INFO runtime: Registered dataset eth_recent_blocks
2024-05-20T22:50:17.998125Z  INFO runtime::accelerated_table::refresh: Loading data for dataset eth_recent_blocks
```

**Step 4.** In a new terminal window, use the Spice SQL REPL to query the dataset

```bash
spice sql
```

```bash
SELECT number, size, gas_used from eth_recent_blocks LIMIT 10;
```

The output displays the results of the query along with the query execution time:

```bash
+----------+--------+----------+
| number   | size   | gas_used |
+----------+--------+----------+
| 19281345 | 400378 | 16150051 |
| 19281344 | 200501 | 16480224 |
| 19281343 | 97758  | 12605531 |
| 19281342 | 89629  | 12035385 |
| 19281341 | 133649 | 13335719 |
| 19281340 | 307584 | 18389159 |
| 19281339 | 89233  | 13391332 |
| 19281338 | 75250  | 12806684 |
| 19281337 | 100721 | 11823522 |
| 19281336 | 150137 | 13418403 |
+----------+--------+----------+

Query took: 0.004057791 seconds
```

You can experiment with the time it takes to generate queries when using non-accelerated datasets. You can change the acceleration setting from `true` to `false` in the datasets.yaml file.
