The default secret store is the `file` secret store which stores secrets in a file located at `~/.spice/auth`.

The Spice CLI offers the `spice login` command to streamline credential storage using the file secret store. When using `spice login`, credentials are automatically stored in the `~/.spice/auth` file under `spiceai`.
