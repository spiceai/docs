# Spice.ai OSS

## What is Spice?

**Spice** is a portable runtime providing developers with a unified SQL interface to materialize, accelerate, and query data sourced from any database, data warehouse, or data lake.

üì£ Read the [Spice.ai OSS announcement blog post](https://blog.spiceai.org/posts/2024/03/28/adding-spice-the-next-generation-of-spice.ai-oss/).

Spice connects, fuses, and delivers data to applications and AI, acting as an application-specific, tier-optimized Database CDN.

The Spice runtime is written in Rust and is built-with industry leading technologies like [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org), Apache Arrow, Apache Arrow Flight, SQlite, and DuckDB.

## Why Spice?

Spice makes querying data by SQL across one or more data sources simple and fast. Easily co-locate a managed working set of data with your application or ML, accelerated with in-memory Arrow, with SQLite/DuckDB, or with attached PostgreSQL for high-performance, low-latency queries. Accelerated engines run tier-native in your infrastructure giving you flexibility and control over cost and performance.

### How is Spice different?

1. Tier-optimized Acceleration with **both OLAP (Arrow/DuckDB) and OLTP (SQLite/PostgreSQL)** databases at dataset granularity compared to other OLAP only or OLTP only systems.

2. **Separation of materialization and storage/compute** compared with monolith data systems and data lakes. Keep compute colocated with source data while bringing a materialized working set next to your application, dashboard, or data/ML pipeline.

3. **Edge to cloud native**. Designed to be deployed standalone, as a container sidecar, as a microservice, in a cluster across laptops, the Edge, On-Prem, to a POP, and to all public clouds. Spice instances can also be chained, and deployed distributed across tiers of infrastructure.

### With Spice

<ThemeBasedImage width="900" alt="With Spice" lightSrc="https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/assets/80174/b57514fe-d53d-42de-b8f0-97ae313c5708" darkSrc="https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/assets/80174/02dbedb4-b209-4d08-bf83-4785a1bf886f" />

### Example Use-Cases

**1. Faster applications and frontends.** Accelerate and co-locate datasets with applications and frontends, to serve more concurrent queries and users with faster page loads and data updates. [Try the CQRS sample app](https://github.com/spiceai/samples/tree/trunk/acceleration#local-materialization-and-acceleration-cqrs-sample)

**2. Faster dashboards, analytics, and BI.** Faster, more responsive dashboards without massive compute costs. [Watch the Apache Superset demo](https://github.com/spiceai/samples/blob/trunk/sales-bi/README.md)

**3. Faster data pipelines, machine learning training and inferencing.** Co-locate datasets in pipelines where the data is needed to minimize data-movement and improve query performance. [Predict hard drive failure with the SMART data demo](https://github.com/spiceai/demos/tree/trunk/smart-demo#spiceai-smart-demo)

**4. Easily query many data sources.** Federated SQL query across databases, data warehouses, and data lakes using [Data Connectors](/data-connectors).

### FAQ

- **Is Spice a cache?** No, however you can think of Spice data materialization like an _active_ cache or data prefetcher. A cache would fetch data on a cache-miss while Spice prefetches and materializes filtered data on an interval or as new data becomes available. In addition to materialization Spice supports [results caching](/features/caching).

- **Is Spice a CDN for databases?** Yes, you can think of Spice like a CDN for different data sources. Using CDN concepts, Spice enables you to ship (load) a working set of your database (or data lake, or data warehouse) where it's most frequently accessed, like from a data application or for AI-inference.

:::warning[DEVELOPER PREVIEW]
Spice is under active **alpha** stage development and is not intended to be used in production until its **1.0-stable** release. If you are interested in running Spice in production, please get in touch below so we can support you.

### Intelligent Applications

Spice enables developers to build both data _and_ AI-driven applications by co-locating data _and_ ML models with applications. Read more about the vision to enable the development of [intelligent AI-driven applications](./intelligent-applications/index.md).
