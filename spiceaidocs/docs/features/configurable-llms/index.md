Spice supports language models (LLMs) from several sources (see [model components](/components/models/index.md)) and provides configuration for how inference will be performed in the Spice runtime. This includes:
 - Providing tools to the language model, enabling it to interact with the Spice runtime.
 - Specifying system prompts and overriding defaults for [`v1/chat/completion`](/api/http/chat-completions.md).
