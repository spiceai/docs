---

Constraints are rules that enforce data integrity in a database. Spice supports constraints on locally accelerated tables to ensure data quality, as well as configuring the behavior for inserting data updates that violate constraints.

Constraints are specified in the Spicepod via the `primary_key` field in the acceleration configuration. Additional unique constraints are specified via the [`indexes`](./indexes.md) field with the value `unique`.

The behavior of inserting data that violates the constraint can be configured via the `on_conflict` field to either `drop` the data that violates the constraint or `upsert` that data into the accelerated table (i.e. update all values other than the columns that are part of the constraint to match the incoming data).

If there are multiple rows in the incoming data that violate any constraint, the entire incoming batch of data will be dropped.

Example Spicepod:

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: spice.ai/eth.recent_blocks
    name: eth.recent_blocks
    acceleration:
      enabled: true
      engine: sqlite
      primary_key: hash # Define a primary key on the `hash` column
      indexes:
        '(number, timestamp)': unique # Add a unique index with a multicolumn key comprised of the `number` and `timestamp` columns
      on_conflict:
        # Upsert the incoming data when the primary key constraint on "hash" is violated,
        # alternatively "drop" can be used instead of "upsert" to drop the data update.
        hash: upsert
```

## Column References

Column references can be used to specify which columns are part of the constraint. The column reference can be a single column name or a multicolumn key. The column reference must be enclosed in parentheses if it is a multicolumn key.

Examples

- `number`: Reference a constraint on the `number` column
- `(hash, timestamp)`: Reference a constraint on the `hash` and `timestamp` columns

## Limitations

- **Not supported for in-memory Arrow:** The default in-memory Arrow acceleration engine does not support constraints. Use [DuckDB](/components/data-accelerators/duckdb.md), [SQLite](/components/data-accelerators/duckdb.md), or [PostgreSQL](/components/data-accelerators/postgres/index.md) as the acceleration engine to enable constraint checking.
- **Single on_conflict target supported**: Only a single `on_conflict` target can be specified, unless all `on_conflict` targets are specified with drop.

        The following Spicepod is invalid because it specifies multiple `on_conflict` targets with `upsert`:

      ```yaml

        indexes:

          The following Spicepod is valid because it specifies multiple `on_conflict` targets with `drop`, which is allowed:

- **DuckDB Limitations:**

  - DuckDB does not support `upsert` for datasets with List or Map types.
  - Standard indexes unexpectedly act like unique indexes and block updates when `upsert` is configured.

    - <details>
        <summary>Standard indexes blocking updates</summary>
        <div>
          The following Spicepod specifies a standard index on the `number` column, which blocks updates when `upsert` is configured for the `hash` column:

          ```yaml
          datasets:
            - from: spice.ai/eth.recent_blocks
              name: eth.recent_blocks
              acceleration:
                enabled: true
                engine: duckdb
                primary_key: hash
                indexes:
                  number: enabled
                on_conflict:
                  hash: upsert
          ```

          The following error is returned when attempting to upsert data into the `eth.recent_blocks` table:

          ```bash
          ERROR runtime::accelerated_table::refresh: Error adding data for eth.recent_blocks: External error:
          Unable to insert into duckdb table: Binder Error: Can not assign to column 'number' because
          it has a UNIQUE/PRIMARY KEY constraint
          ```

          This is a limitation in DuckDB.
