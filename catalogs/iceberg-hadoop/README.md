# Iceberg Hadoop Catalog Connector

The Iceberg Catalog Connector supports connecting to Hadoop catalogs, locally or on S3-compatible object storage.

This recipe uses the Spice Runtime to connect to a TPCH dataset, configured on a MinIO Object Store.

## Prerequisites

- Docker is installed, to run the sample MinIO object store service with Hadoop catalog.
- Spice is installed (see the [Getting Started](https://docs.spiceai.org/getting-started) documentation).

## Step 1: Start the MinIO Server

Clone the Spice cookbook repository and navigate to the `iceberg-hadoop` directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spiceai/cookbook.git # Skip if already cloned
cd cookbook/catalogs/iceberg-hadoop
```

Use the provided Docker Compose file to start a MinIO server, which sets up with a TPCH dataset:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Step 2: Start the Spice Runtime

Once Docker has finished starting, enter into the provided spicepod directory and start the Spice Runtime:

```bash
cd hadoop-catalog-recipe
spice run
```

The Runtime should start and register the TPCH catalog. Example output:

```console

2025-08-07T02:51:44.453020Z  INFO runtime: All components are loaded. Spice runtime is ready!
```

## Step 3: Query the Hadoop Catalog

In a new terminal, run the Spice SQL REPL and execute an SQL command to read TPCH data from the Hadoop catalog:

```bash
spice sql
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM hadoop.tpch.region;
```

Example output:

```console
+-------------+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

## Step 4: Cleanup

```bash
docker-compose down
```
